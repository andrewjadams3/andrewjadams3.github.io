          Overview
        </h6>
        <p>
          In early 2016, a small team of engineers at Narrative Science launched
          <a href="https://narrativescience.com/Partners/Business-Intelligence/Qlik-Sense">Narratives for Qlik</a>,
          a third-party extension for
          <a href="https://www.qlik.com/us/products/qlik-sense">Qlik Sense</a>
          which automatically generated shareable, dynamic insights about
          charts and data in plain english. This small idea exploded in
          popularity, and soon thousands of users were generating and sharing
          narratives within their organizations.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was brought on board shortly after launch to not only improve the
          existing UI, but to help expand this success to other business
          intelligence (BI) tools. By closely examining and iterating on
          feedback, we were able to increase user engagement with core features
          by 127%. Over time, this allowed us to expand the productâ€™s overall
          capabilities in ways which addressed the needs of our expanding user
          base.

          Case study
        </h6>
        <h3 class="subpage-heading">Understanding</h3>
        <p>
          While not much was known about our initial users, the original
          engineering team had implemented event tracking using
          <a href="https://mixpanel.com">Mixpanel</a> which logged most user
          interactions. They had also built a basic feedback system which
          allowed users to reach out with questions and feature requests.
        </p>
        <p>
          By looking first at direct feedback, we learned the most common
          complaint about the current functionality revolved around language
          quality and depth. In short - users thought our insights
          sounded clunky.
        </p>
        <img src="/images/qlik-dashboard.png"
            class="subpage-image inline-image"
            alt="qlik sense dashboard" />
        <p>
          Most clunky language could be solved by tweaking a few configuration
          items which were already available to the user. However, by examining
          the Mixpanel data, we discovered that most users never took advantage
          of these settings, and those who did seemed to only adjust a small
          subset.
        </p>
        <p>
          By performing an internal UX audit the issue became apparent: our
          narrative settings were not only difficult to find, but highly
          confusing. Anyone unfamiliar with the extension could not articulate
          how adjusting the majority of our settings would affect the insights.
        </p>
      </div>
    </section>
    <section id="ideation" class="subpage-section">
      <div class="container">
        <h3 class="subpage-heading">Ideation</h3>
        <p>
          I began by mapping out all configuration items and collaborating with
          engineers to understand how they each work together. Often, adjusting
          one piece of configuration would affect the ability to change others.
          Using this information I was able to map a layout of independent
          pieces and indicate the order in which they were required to be set.
          I eventually landed on three sequential categories of configuration.
        </p>
        <img src="/images/qlik-ideas.jpg"
            class="subpage-image inline-image"
            alt="whiteboard diagram" />
      </div>
    </section>
    <section id="wireframes" class="subpage-section">
      <div class="container">
        <h3 class="subpage-heading">Wireframes</h3>
        <p>
          Using these three categories, I came up with several iterations of
          potential layouts and user flows. Because of the linear nature of the
          configuration items, I was drawn to a dynamic wizard layout which
          would walk the user through each necessary step while hiding anything
          that was irrelevant down the line.
        </p>
        <img src="/images/qlik-wireframe.png"
            class="subpage-image inline-image"
            alt="narratives for qlik wireframe" />
      </div>
    </section>
    <section id="testing" class="subpage-section">
      <div class="container">
        <h3 class="subpage-heading">Testing</h3>
        <p>
          I set up several user tests with internal employees as well as active
          users to gather feedback on this approach. By comparing our current
          layout to the new wizard, I determined that user understanding of the
          configuration items in the wizard format was noticeably higher. This
          resulted in narratives with more natural sounding language and
          improved readability.
        </p>
        <p>
          Using an iterative testing approach, I made adjustments to the
          wireframes after each testing session. User feedback allowed me to
          fine-tune the configuration item categories and ensured that each was
          laid out in an understandable manner. The end result was a natural
          flow through the wizard with the added affordance of quick navigation
          for advanced users.
        </p>

    <section id="mockups" class="subpage-section">
      <div class="container">
        <h3 class="subpage-heading">Mockups</h3>
        <p>
          Because our extension existed as a component of a larger piece of
          software, I strove to match the look and feel of Qlik Sense in order
          to increase user trust and understanding. Using Sketch, I mocked up
          how each narrative extension would be initialized, configured, and
          ultimately consumed by the end user.
        </p>
        <img src="/images/qlik-mockup.png"
            class="subpage-image inline-image"
            alt="narratives for qlik mockup" />
      </div>
    </section>
    <section id="mockups" class="subpage-section">
      <div class="container">
        <h3 class="subpage-heading">Outcome</h3>
        <p>
          Building upon the existing extension framework, I created an
          automatic, opt-out settings modal using AngularJS. Mimicking the
          functionality found in native Qlik Sense visualizations, the end
          result was an extension which felt native, familiar, and simple to
          use.
        </p>

            class="subpage-image inline-image"
            alt="narratives for qlik interactive modal" />
        <p>
          A month after launch, we consulted our Mixpanel data and found an
          increase in overall engagement with the narrative settings of 127%.
          Users were not only finding the settings, but using them as intended
          to actively improve their narratives.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because of the success of the product and subsequent UX overhaul we
          were able to expand our learnings to several other BI platforms.
          Moving forward I led both the design and development of two
          additional BI extensions:
          <a href="https://narrativescience.com/Partners/Business-Intelligence/Tableau">Narratives for Tableau</a>
          and
          <a href="https://narrativescience.com/Partners/Business-Intelligence/SAP-BusinessObjects-Lumira">Narratives for Lumira</a>.
