    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Just a few days ago, I completed my first week of Phase 0 in preparation for attending Dev Bootcamp. I would have written this blog post sooner, but to be honest, I needed a break from writing. I&rsquo;ve never believed writing to be one of my strong suits, but I created this blog so I could gain experience, and also improve my abilities to communicate my thoughts and feelings. As it turns out, the challenges for Phase 0 in DBC are requiring me to do just that! For every coding objective I complete, I have been spending just as much time (if not more) reflecting on what I learned/how I felt. It&rsquo;s a requirement, and I&rsquo;ll admit, it&rsquo;s a bit tedious. I&rsquo;ve been finding myself completing an objective in a timely manner, and immediately wasting an hour or two browsing Reddit to avoid writing the reflection. <em>But.</em> I can already tell that these reflections are going to make the difference between completing an objective, and actually <em>learning</em> an objective.</p>

<p>When I first began learning web development on my own, I was a sponge, absorbing any new piece of information that I could find. As I progressed, however, I began to feel a bit overwhelmed by the enormous amount of resources, documentation, and tutorials available online. It became difficult to differentiate between what was useful and what was superfluous. This was part of the reason I enrolled in DBC; I needed some guidance and direction from those who truly know the difference. Part of the issue, though, was that the more I read, the more I started to skim and skip through sections of material. The satisfaction of completing a chapter in a book became irrelevant when I realized that I didn&rsquo;t understand most of it. But this past week, when I was forced to not only practice, but reflect on the material, I found that I once again gained the ability to truly absorb and retain information.</p>

<p>I may not be a fan of putting my thought process into words, but if doing so will help me improve as a developer and a person, I&rsquo;m all for it. <strong>That&rsquo;s</strong> why I&rsquo;m writing this post right now. <strong>That&rsquo;s</strong> why I&rsquo;m headed to DBC. I can&rsquo;t wait for week 2.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s been less than a month since I launched this blog, but this weekend I decided it was time for an overhaul. I originally used WordPress so I could have more control over my content, but I ended up feeling uneasy about the whole thing. Most of the theming options were too flashy, and in my opinion, difficult to customize. Writing my posts in a web-based editor turned out to be less than ideal, and I didn&rsquo;t feel like my content was secure unless I made frequent backups. I needed a simpler way to blog that put me in total control. That&rsquo;s when I discovered <a href="http://octopress.org/" title="Octopress">Octopress</a>.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>Octopress is a blog framework designed for <a href="https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll" title="Jekyll">Jekyll</a>, a static site generator. Octopress comes with great customizable templates, useful plugins, and is very simple to set up. All posts are written in <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax" title="Markdown">Markdown</a> syntax, and then &ldquo;baked&rdquo; into static HTML when the site is generated. In fact, the entire site is baked before it is deployed, making it extremely lightweight and responsive.</p>

<p>I now have the ability to develop my blog entirely on my personal machine and preview changes through a local server. The best part is that Octopress is compatible with <a href="https://pages.github.com/" title="GitHub Pages">GitHub Pages</a>, therefore allowing me to simply push my content (both the static site and source code) to GitHub to deploy updates. How cool is that?</p>

<p>Octopress bills itself as &ldquo;A Blogging Framework for Hackers.&rdquo; As such, it ships with several plugins for sharing code snippets and embedding files. I&rsquo;m excited to start sharing my work on this blog as I start digging deeper into web development, and these plugins are going to make it a whole lot easier.</p>

<p>Making the switch was quite easy (and not just because I&rsquo;ve only published a handful of posts). There are many tools available to help convert WordPress or HTML content to Markdown. Just search around, you should be able to find one that works for you. If you&rsquo;re unhappy with your current blog, or are considering starting a new one, I highly recommend you take a look at <a href="http://octopress.org/" title="Octopress">Octopress</a>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As I&rsquo;ve been working my way through <a title="Rails Tutorial" href="http://ruby.railstutorial.org/" target="_blank">Michael Hartl&rsquo;s Rails Tutorial</a>, I&rsquo;ve become increasingly aware of just how beneficial taking <a title="CS 253 Web Development" href="https://www.udacity.com/course/cs253" target="_blank">Steve Huffman&rsquo;s web development course</a> back in January really was. While I think the Rails tutorial is great, a lot copying and pasting code is required, which is followed only by a brief overview of what it does. Not to mention, much of the code is heavily abstracted in order to save time.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>I now understand why Steve took the approach of teaching web development on a low-level framework: by getting your hands dirty and coding many of the functions that are already built into Rails and other frameworks, you gain a deeper understanding of the intricate connections within a dynamic website. While I am still learning, I find it much easier to understand the parallels between what the tutorial is showing me, and what I have already accomplished.</p>

<p>That being said, I am truly enjoying the comparative simplicity of Rails! After Steve repeatedly warned against high-level frameworks, I was a little wary to make a switch. However, <a title="Does Rails and Django abstract away too much for beginners?" href="http://qr.ae/vlN3S" target="_blank">this post on Quora</a> convinced me otherwise. <a id="__w2_eLPo9ze_link" href="http://www.quora.com/Nupul-Kukreja">Nupul Kukreja</a> provides the analogy of building a car:
<blockquote><p>You want something that has already put the major parts of the car together so that you can focus on designing the car itself and not worry about putting the engine, steering wheel, seats etc., all together.</p></blockquote>
Focusing on design aspects will certainly be one of my next big challenges, but I can already see Rails opening up many opportunities to experiment and learn.</p>

    <id>http://andrewada.ms/blog/2014/new-projects-on-github</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve just added the source code for a couple of projects I completed for Udacity&rsquo;s web development course to my <a title="andrewjadams3 on GitHub" href="https://github.com/andrewjadams3" target="_blank">Github</a>. The first is a <a title="CS 253 Blog" href="https://github.com/andrewjadams3/CS-253-Blog" target="_blank">simple blog</a> with some basic features like user authentication and adding posts (the templates certainly need updating though). The second is a <a title="CS 253 Wiki" href="https://github.com/andrewjadams3/CS-253-Wiki" target="_blank">wiki</a> which is slightly more complex, fleshed out, and user-friendly. Both apps are Python-based and hosted on Google App Engine.</p>

<p>I will be featuring some of my work on the <a title="Projects" href="http://andrewada.ms/projects" target="_blank">projects page</a> of this site as I continue to develop and learn. I am working through <a title="Michael Hartl's Ruby on Rails Tutorial" href="http://ruby.railstutorial.org/" target="_blank">Michael Hartl&rsquo;s Ruby on Rails tutorial</a> at the moment, hopefully I&rsquo;ll be able to share my first rails app soon!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Over the past several months, I have been learning how to code. For some reason, I had always been intimidated by code, and had turned down many opportunities to learn. I had convinced myself that I needed to focus on teaching and music, rather than accept the fact that I was afraid to fail. However, as soon as I took the leap, I was hooked.</p>

<p>At the onset, I adopted the attitude that I would &ldquo;teach myself&rdquo;, and simply absorb new information as I went along. After all, that&rsquo;s how it worked when I was a kid &ndash; building silly websites and copying javascript examples! While this was possible to an extent, I soon discovered that I couldn&rsquo;t do everything alone. The number of people online who are eager to share their knowledge about any given subject is unbelievable. I needed to become a student and allow myself to learn from them.</p>

<p>After completing a few tracks on <a title="Code Academy" href="http://codeacademy.com" target="_blank">Code Academy</a>, I enrolled in <a title="Udacity CS 101" href="https://www.udacity.com/course/cs101" target="_blank">CS101 on Udacity.</a> From there, I moved on to <a title="Udacity CS 253" href="https://www.udacity.com/course/cs253" target="_blank">Steve Huffman&rsquo;s web development course</a>, and even took a refresher in <a title="Udacity ST 101" href="https://www.udacity.com/course/st101" target="_blank">statistics</a>. In just over a month, I was parsing HTML, managing databases, and using tons of cool acronyms. I&rsquo;ve have since been working on numerous code challenges and side projects, and diving into too many books to remember.</p>

<p>When I first read about <a title="Dev Bootcamp" href="http://devbootcamp.com/" target="_blank">Dev Bootcamp</a>, it seemed like exactly the type of experience I needed: intense learning, constant collaboration and support, and the prospect of a new career in the field I was engrossed in.  After reading overwhelmingly positive reviews from alumni (like <a title="Natasha the Robot" href="http://natashatherobot.com/" target="_blank">Natasha the Robot</a>), I decided to take a chance and apply.</p>

<p>Now I&rsquo;m in! In June, I&rsquo;ll be leaving my friends, family, and job in Kansas City to move to Chicago for 9 weeks. I still have no idea if I&rsquo;ll stay, move back, or head somewhere else entirely, but this is a huge step. I&rsquo;ve already begun the transition from Python to Ruby, and am following <a title="DBC Prep Objectives" href="https://gist.github.com/andrewjadams3/9572050#dbc-prep-objectives" target="_blank">this checklist</a> to prepare. I&rsquo;ll be updating this blog (with considerably shorter posts from now on) with projects, discoveries, failures, and successes. I can&rsquo;t wait to find out where these next few months will lead!</p>
