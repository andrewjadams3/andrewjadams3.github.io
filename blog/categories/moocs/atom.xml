    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve noticed several blogs focusing on the deficiency of STEM education in the U.S. while offering up a handful of potential solutions. This week, I would like to focus on the obstacles and struggles facing one of these solutions in particular: MOOCs.</p>

<p>MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses) have been around in some respects for many years, but the term was just recently coined in 2008. In a modern sense, it refers to a course in which the subject matter is presented and accessed via the web. In the last two or three years, a number of universities and independent companies began offering MOOCs covering subjects associated with STEM professions, including introductions to computer science, statistics, genetics, and more. You can find these courses on sites like <a href="http://udacity.com">Udacity</a>, <a href="http://khanacademy.org">Khan Academy</a>, <a href="http://coursera.org">Coursera</a>, and <a href="http://edx.org">edX</a>.</p>

<p>Interest and enrollment in these courses have been skyrocketing, and many hope that sites like these will become viable alternatives to attending traditional higher educational institutions. However, similarly to DBC, most founders admit that their models are still experiments, far from perfect, and have numerous flaws. In fact, Sebastian Thrun, founder of Udacity, flatly stated that his MOOCs were &ldquo;lousy products&rdquo; after it was revealed that only 4% of students ever completed a course. Statistics like these have put a damper on the excitement which once surrounded the MOOC community. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean that MOOCs aren&rsquo;t or can&rsquo;t be effective learning platforms.</p>

<p>I will proudly tell you that I began my journey to becoming a developer by completing a number of online courses (I even have the pdf certificates to prove it!) I must also admit that I started twice as many courses as I finished. After completing an introduction to computer science course, I immediately enrolled in a course on parsing/lexing programming languages. About halfway through, I discovered that I had not developed the practical programming skills required to complete many of the assignments. Similarly, I finished a course in statistics, and soon after enrolled in a course on data analysis. Again, I quickly discovered that while I understood the basic concepts of statistics, I didn&rsquo;t have the experience with many of the statistical models required to develop accurate analyses.</p>

<p>This highlights one of the issues with MOOCs. Many of the introductory courses are simply not comprehensive, or do not provide adequate hands-on experience. Many students also complain that there is a notable lack of support for those who are struggling. Without a mentor or a tutor, some of the complexities can be impossible to grasp.</p>

<p>Does this mean that these courses are useless? Absolutely not. The introduction to computer science course may not have taught me everything I needed to become a developer, but it did provide a solid foundation, and most importantly, showed me that I was capable of breaking into a new field of study. I may not become a data scientist from a half-completed data analysis course, but I do have a deeper respect for the profession, and a solid understanding of the role and importance of data science in our society.</p>

<p>Although many companies are starting to offer paid support in the form of tutoring and guided project development, there is still a profound sense of isolation when completing a MOOC. While this may result in high dropout rates, I believe those who stick with a course gain a better set of problem-solving and research skills, both of which are strong assets in any STEM career. The most beneficial course that I completed (and my personal favorite) was <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/cs253">Udacity&rsquo;s CS 253: Web Development</a>. There were certainly times where I felt lost, confused, and frustrated when trying to complete an assignment. By the end however, I not only understood what a web developer was, I actually felt like one. It is because of that course that I am enrolled in DBC and am truly enjoying my work.</p>

<p>These are just a handful of concerns, and more research will show that there are many more obstacles for MOOCs to tackle before they can truly solve the issues facing STEM education. However, I believe that it is possible, and it is my hope that with the knowledge I gain through non-traditional educational models, I too will be able to help solve these problems.</p>
